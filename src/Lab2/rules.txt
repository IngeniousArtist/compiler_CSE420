EMAIL:
=====================
The local-part of the email address may use any of these ASCII characters:

uppercase and lowercase Latin letters A to Z and a to z;

digits 0 to 9;

special characters !#$%&'*+-/=?^_`{|}~;

dot ., provided that it is not the first or last character unless quoted,
and provided also that it does not appear consecutively unless quoted
(e.g. John..Doe@example.com is not allowed but "John..Doe"@example.com is allowed);

space and "(),:;<>@[\] characters are allowed with restrictions (they are only allowed inside a quoted string,
as described in the paragraph below, and in addition, a backslash or double-quote must be preceded by a backslash);

comments are allowed with parentheses at either end of the local-part;
e.g. john.smith(comment)@example.com and (comment)john.smith@example.com
are both equivalent to john.smith@example.com.


WEB:
=====================
Regardless of the extension, all domain names must follow the same character rules...
You can use letters (abc), numbers (123) and dashes/hyphens (---).
Spaces are not allowed and the domain can't begin or end with a dash.
